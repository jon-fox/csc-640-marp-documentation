## Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to building quality software, created to help current and future team members understand the principles, tools, and practices that lead to maintainable, scalable, and reliable software systems.

Throughout this semester, I'm building a REST API project that demonstrates these quality software principles in practice. This documentation will evolve weekly as I apply new concepts and tools.

The REST API project is for managing ai agents, I have defined the API endpoints below.

## Week 1: Foundation and Planning (October 18-24, 2025)

### What is Quality Software?

Quality software is code that is:
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **Reliable**: Works consistently and handles errors gracefully
- **Secure**: Protects data and requires proper authentication
- **Scalable**: Can grow with increasing demands
- **Well-documented**: Others can understand and work with it

### Project Planning: AI Agent Management System

This week I designed a REST API for managing AI agents and their tasks. Proper planning is the foundation of quality software - rushing into code without design leads to technical debt.

**API Design (14 endpoints):**

*Public Endpoints (7):*
1. `GET /agents` - List all agents
2. `GET /agents/{id}` - Get agent details
3. `GET /tasks` - List all tasks
4. `GET /tasks/{id}` - Get task details
5. `GET /tools` - List available tools
6. `GET /logs` - Get execution logs
7. `GET /tasks/{id}/status` - Get task status

*Secure Endpoints (7 - require Bearer token):*
8. `POST /agents` - Create new agent
9. `PUT /agents/{id}` - Update agent
10. `DELETE /agents/{id}` - Delete agent
11. `POST /tasks` - Create task
12. `PUT /tasks/{id}` - Update task
13. `DELETE /tasks/{id}` - Delete task
14. `POST /agents/{id}/execute` - Execute agent

**Quality Principle Applied:** Clear separation between public read operations and secure write operations. Authentication protects data integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications.

### Development Environment Setup

Setting up a proper development environment is crucial for consistency and reducing "it works on my machine" problems.

**Tools Configured:**
- **NGINX + PHP-FPM**: Production-like local server environment
- **MySQL**: Structured data storage with ACID compliance
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **VSCode + Marp**: Documentation and presentation tools

**Quality Principle Applied:** Using NGINX locally mirrors production environments, catching configuration issues early. Version control enables collaboration and rollback capabilities.

### Milestone-Based Planning

Breaking work into milestones prevents cramming and allows for iterative testing and feedback.

**Project Timeline:**
- **Milestone 1** (Oct 25): Database schema and tables
- **Milestone 2** (Nov 1): All API endpoints functional locally
- **Milestone 3** (Nov 7): Agent backend with state management

**Quality Principle Applied:** Incremental development with clear checkpoints ensures each component works before building the next. This catches bugs early when they're cheaper to fix.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Plan before coding** - Design your API structure and authentication before writing code
2. **Environment matters** - Development environments should mirror production
3. **Break work into milestones** - Small, testable increments beat big-bang releases
4. **Security from the start** - Don't add authentication as an afterthought

### HW2 Completion: OOP and Software Design Principles

This week I also completed HW2, which focused on object-oriented programming concepts and software design principles. The assignment reinforced key principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction all of which are essential for building maintainable and scalable software systems. Understanding these OOP fundamentals directly supports the quality software goals outlined in this project, as proper object design leads to more organized, reusable, and testable code.
