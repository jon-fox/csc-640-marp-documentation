## Quick Start

Each markdown file covers a specific aspect of quality software with practical examples from the [HW4 AI Agent Management REST API](https://github.com/jon-fox/rest-api-php-server-project) project (raw PHP → Laravel migration).

Read sequentially for full context, or jump to specific topics as needed.

## HW4 Project Reference

The examples throughout this documentation reference the [REST API PHP Server Project](https://github.com/jon-fox/rest-api-php-server-project), which demonstrates quality software principles through a two-stage implementation:
- **Stage 1:** Raw PHP implementation with manual auth, routing, and database handling
- **Stage 2:** Laravel migration with framework-based security, testing, and deployment
