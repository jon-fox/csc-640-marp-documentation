# Quality Software

This report documents my understanding of quality software developed throughout the Fall 2025 semester. Quality software became tangible when reviewing code or working with poorly designed systems during project development.

Throughout this semester's work, security emerged as a critical consideration. Input validation and authentication protecting sensitive operations became essential priorities when building projects, where improper validation could expose vulnerabilities.

Simplicity proved vital for maintainability during iterative development. High complexity made systems difficult to extend during later project phases. Simple implementations enabled more effective iteration and future team collaboration across codebases.

Documentation's value became clear when returning to earlier work or enabling others to use projects. Systems that new team members could run without external assistance demonstrated quality documentation, reducing friction and enabling efficient collaboration.

## This Documentation

Throughout this documentation I use the [REST API PHP Server Project](https://github.com/jon-fox/rest-api-php-server-project) as an example along with other callouts from previous frameworks and docs I've written. [Example Documentation Published to Medium](https://medium.com/aws-tip/aws-sso-setup-with-organizations-for-terraform-cli-assumable-roles-922348c015bb). This [Graduate MCP smart hub research project](https://github.com/jon-fox/raspberry-mcp).
