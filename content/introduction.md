# Quality Software

Quality software isn't exactly something I lose sleep over until I'm actually reviewing a PR or working with poorly designed software.

Security matters. Is the input being validated? Is auth actually protecting sensitive operations?

Simplicity is huge. High complexity becomes impossible to maintain. Simple implementations are often the most effective for future extension and iteration.

Documentation saves time. Can someone new actually get this running without external assistance.
