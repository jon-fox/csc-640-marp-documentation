# What is Quality Software?

Quality software works correctly, stays maintainable over time, and doesn't create headaches for the people who have to work with it.

### Core Attributes

**Maintainable** - Other developers can read your code and understand what's happening. Changes don't break everything.

**Reliable** - The software does what it's supposed to do, consistently. Errors get handled instead of crashing.

**Secure** - Authentication protects sensitive operations. User data doesn't leak because someone forgot to validate input.

**Scalable** - Growing from 100 users to 10,000 users doesn't require rebuilding from scratch.

**Well-documented** - Someone new to the project can actually get it running without hunting you down for answers.

## Why Quality Matters

Finding a bug in production costs about 100 times more than catching it during development. Every shortcut you take today becomes technical debt that slows you down later.

Teams working with quality codebases ship faster because they're building features instead of fixing bugs.

### Real-World Impact

One SQL injection bug can expose millions of records. Missing documentation means every new developer has to reverse-engineer your API. Skipping tests means production breaks and users lose trust.

> These aren't hypothetical problems. They happen constantly to teams that don't prioritize quality.
